# A Header

A paragraph is a cool thing.

Two paragraphs are even cooler.
With multiple sentences on multiple lines!!

## A Sub-header

A longer paragraph with multiple lines of text.
And many sentences, which can be hard to parse.
Also a single unfinished sentence

## Inlines

There exist many inlines, commas ",", colons ":", and semicolons ";".
Furthermore, we have numbers (100), and decimal numbers (10.0) and separated numbers (1,000.0).
We can also add currency $100, $ 100, and 100,- kr, which are rendered differently.
We can also use some special characters æøå.
Abv\. and list numbers 1\. are okay, but you need to make sure they are escaped.

-- And comments, are newer changed
-- like this.

## Sub-sentences

It is possible to write longer "sentences" with stuff in them; like parentheses (like this!).
We can also add other things like /italic/, *bold*, and /*italic bold*/.

When there are multiple sentences in a qoute, they will be placed on a new line:
"hello, this is a dual sentence qoute!
like this".

/*We can even have italic and bolded code on two lines.
For example, like this!
Or this*/
/*The same for the second sentence fragment.
Like this.*/

### "Qoutes in Headers are possible"

### "Even with two! Sentences!"

### And two sentences in a header? That's okay.

## Itemized Lists

We can create itemized lists:

- One item.
- Two items.
- Three items.

Items can have different starting annotations `*`, `-`, or `+`.

- Minus
+ Plus
* Star

Items can contain multiple sentences

- First sentences.
  Second sentence.
  Third sentence.

Finally we have nested lists and paragraphs.
When items have nested items or paragraphs they are separated by newlines:

- Item one:

  Hello paragraph

  - Nested one.
  - Nested two.
  - Nested three.

  Some other thing

  - Another nested list

- Item two.

  With an extra paragraph.

- Item three.

  -- With comment lines
  -- like this

When a list only contains of items, we can compress them:

- First Item
  - Sub items 1 and
  - sub items 2
- Second Item.
  With multiple sentences.
  - More subitems.

We can also have two blocks with items, they need to be separated by two newlines:

- First block


- Second block

## Numbered lists

We also have numbered lists.
The numbering is not important and will be forgotten.
They are differentiated from sentences containing one number: `1.` by using closing parentheses.
Like this:

1) One

2) Two

3) Three

Numbered lists do not compress right now.
